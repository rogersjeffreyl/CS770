\f0\b\fs22 \cf0 Interviewer: 
\b0 Hello. How are you doing today?\
\pard\pardeftab720\ri-720\partightenfactor0

\b \cf2 Interviewee:\cf0  
\b0 Very fine.\
\pard\pardeftab720\ri-720\partightenfactor0

\b \cf0 Interviewer: 
\b0 Thank you very much for agreeing to participate in this survey.\
I have a couple of questions to ask you. So let's get started with it. First, can you describe your normal day looks like? What are the activities you do on a daily basis?\
\pard\pardeftab720\ri-720\partightenfactor0

\b \cf2 Interviewee:\cf3  
\b0 \cf0 Early morning, I will get up and I will go for walking for 1 hour. Then I will do some light exercises. Afterwards, I will prepare breakfast.  I will have the breakfast after bathing around 9:00 am. Then I will take some rest. I will listen to some music.\cf0 \{listening_to_music\}\cf0  I like to hear Carnatic music and Sanskrit shlokas \cf0 \{/listening_to_music\}\cf0 and afterwards I will go back to household works, for cooking lunch. I will cut the vegetables by myself. \cf4 \{enjoy_cooking\}\cf5 \{cooking\}\cf0 I enjoy cooking. \cf5 \{/cooking\}\cf4 \{/enjoy_cooking\}\cf0 Again after some rest, I will read books, listen to music. I will then have lunch and take medicines. In the evening, I will simply sit at the balcony, looking at birds and enjoy my time.\
Evening sometimes, I will go for a walk after 6:00 pm. Sometimes, I will visit the temple. \
I will then have some light food in the night and then go to bed by 9:30 or 10:00 pm. That is my daily routine.\
\pard\pardeftab720\ri-720\partightenfactor0

\b \cf0 Interviewer:  
\b0 Ok. Thank you. I heard you mention that you would read something and listen to music and Sanskrit shlokas. Do you use any devices for it?\
\pard\pardeftab720\ri-720\partightenfactor0

\b \cf2 Interviewee: \cf6 \{searching_songs_youtube\}
\b0 \cf0 I have an iPad. I will go to YouTube and search for shlokas. I will also use a CD player\cf6 \{/searching_songs_youtube\}\cf0 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri-720\partightenfactor0

\b \cf0 Interviewer:   
\b0 Ok. Thank you. \

\b Interviewer: 
\b0 You mentioned that you would read something. Is it using the iPad or normal books?\
\pard\pardeftab720\ri-720\partightenfactor0

\b \cf2 Interviewee: \cf7 \{not_use_ipad_for_reading\}
\b0 \cf0 I will not use the iPad for reading.\cf7 \{/not_use_ipad_for_reading\}\cf0  It is just normal books.\
\pard\pardeftab720\ri-720\partightenfactor0

\b \cf0 Interviewer: 
\b0 Do you have any other devices apart from iPad?\
\pard\pardeftab720\ri-720\partightenfactor0

\b \cf2 Interviewee:  
\b0 \cf0 What type of devices you are asking, I am having iPad and cd-player?\
\pard\pardeftab720\ri-720\partightenfactor0

\b \cf0 Interviewer: 
\b0 Do you own any smartphones like iPhone for example.\
\pard\pardeftab720\ri-720\partightenfactor0

\b \cf2 Interviewee:\cf0 \{
\b0 I am having a Samsung phone an android. I have an iPad as well as an android.\

\b Interviewer:  
\b0 You told me that you will use iPad for listening to music. Are you comfortable using the iPad for launching the YouTube app and searching for a particular song?\

\b Interviewee: \{difficult_to_type_and_search\}\cf2  
\b0 \cf0 It is a bit difficult. It would take long time for me to get to the song. Sometimes, there are a lot of advertisements in the middle. Sometimes the app is slower.\cf8 \{/difficult_to_type_and_search\}\cf0 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri-720\partightenfactor0

\b \cf0 Interviewer:   
\b0 Can you elaborate a bit more on the difficulties you have faced while launching or using the iPad?\
\pard\pardeftab720\ri-720\partightenfactor0

\b \cf2 Interviewee:  \cf8 \{difficult_to_type_and_search\}
\b0 \cf0 Sometimes, the internet might not be proper. Sometimes, I might choose a song but a different song might play. sometimes, all of a sudden the song will stop. There are the inconveniences.\cf8 \{/difficult_to_type_and_search\}\cf0 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri-720\partightenfactor0

\b \cf0 Interviewer:   
\b0 Ok. So it is more of an inconvenience with the app. \

\b Interviewer:  
\b0 Considering that you have an iPad, have you heard of something called Siri?\
\pard\pardeftab720\ri-720\partightenfactor0

\b \cf2 Interviewee:  \cf0 \{some_knowledge_about_siri\}
\b0 \cf0 Siri. Yeah yeah. I have heard of it\cf0 \{/some_knowledge_about_siri\}\cf0 .\
\pard\pardeftab720\ri-720\partightenfactor0

\b \cf0 Interviewer:   
\b0 Nice. Can you tell me what you know about Siri?\
\pard\pardeftab720\ri-720\partightenfactor0

\b \cf2 Interviewee:  \cf9 \{not_that_familiar_with_siri\}
\b0 \cf0 Sometimes I see in my iPad something that says "Siri will answer questions". But, I am not that much familiar with that.\cf9 \{/not_that_familiar_with_siri\}\cf0 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri-720\partightenfactor0

\b \cf0 Interviewer:   
\b0 Ok, you have some knowledge about Siri. That is really nice. I assume that while using iPad to listen to songs, you will open the you tube app, type something to search terms in YouTube to search for the song. \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri-720\partightenfactor0

\b \cf2 Interviewee: \cf10 \{typing_and_searching\}\cf0 Yes.\cf10 \{/typing_and_searching\}
\b0 \cf0 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri-720\partightenfactor0

\b \cf0 Interviewer:   
\b0 You mentioned that you might find such a process difficult some times, do you think it will be helpful to you if you think you can talk to Siri to launch the YouTube app and bring the song to you. would it be useful to you?\
\pard\pardeftab720\ri-720\partightenfactor0

\b \cf2 Interviewee: \cf11 \{needs_more_experience_with_siri\}
\b0 \cf0 If it is so, I think so. I have to try that out and only then I can tell.\cf11 \{/needs_more_experience_with_siri\}\cf0 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri-720\partightenfactor0

\b \cf0 Interviewer:  
\b0 You say that if you can speak to Siri in a human voice and instruct Siri to go and do this and go and do that, in this case it would be "Siri launch YouTube for me with some song", you feel that will be more helpful to you, than going and finding the song on your own.\
\pard\pardeftab720\ri-720\partightenfactor0

\b \cf2 Interviewee: 
\b0 \cf0 Yes, sure sure, definitely. I will be very happy to do that.\
\pard\pardeftab720\ri-720\partightenfactor0

\b \cf0 Interviewer:  
\b0 Sure, I would be glad if you could try it out later, and I can get a feedback from you in another interview. Apart from that, you said that you would go for a walk. Do you take your mobile with you on your walk?\
\pard\pardeftab720\ri-720\partightenfactor0

\b \cf2 Interviewee: 
\b0 \cf0 No, I will not take my mobile with me.\
\pard\pardeftab720\ri-720\partightenfactor0

\b \cf0 Interviewer:   
\b0 Ok. Then, I assume that the task you use the iPad for is listening to songs.\
yes\

\b Interviewer:   
\b0 You cook daily. Suppose you want to search for a particular recipe for a new dish, do you use an IPad for it?\
\pard\pardeftab720\ri-720\partightenfactor0

\b \cf2 Interviewee: 
\b0 \cf0 \{type_and_search\}\cf0 Yes. I will go to the iPad and search for it. That also comes in you tube.\cf0 \{/type_and_search\}\cf0  So, in that. Actually, one time I prepared a tofu recipe looking at Youtube.  I was appreciated for that.\
\pard\pardeftab720\ri-720\partightenfactor0

\b \cf0 Interviewer:  
\b0 I guess, you are also using iPad for looking at recipes using YouTube. But it is for a different purpose. That is interesting.\

\b Interviewer:   
\b0 Ok. I assume again you went and typed for searching.\
\pard\pardeftab720\ri-720\partightenfactor0

\b \cf2 Interviewee: 
\b0 \cf0 Yes.\
\pard\pardeftab720\ri-720\partightenfactor0

\b \cf0 Interviewer:  
\b0 Was it really frustrating to type? Did you take a lot of time to get to the right recipe?\
\pard\pardeftab720\ri-720\partightenfactor0

\b \cf2 Interviewee: \cf12 \{type_search_was_not_frustrating\}\{search_was_not_frustrating\}
\b0 \cf0 No, it did not take me long. I just searched for the particular word tofu. Immediately, many results showed up. It was not that frustrating.\cf12 \{/search_was_not_frustrating\}\{/type_search_was_not_frustrating\}\cf0 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri-720\partightenfactor0

\b \cf0 Interviewer:   
\b0 Imagine that you are cooking and you need to look at a recipe. You will have to stop your cooking, then go back to your iPad to type your search terms. Would you prefer a system that you can interact with through voice? For instance, while you are cooking you can talk to Siri and say "hey Siri, give me the recipe for tofu", instead of going and typing it. Thus, you do not have to stop your cooking and you can continue with you cooking and still get to know what the tofu recipes are. Would you prefer that?\
\pard\pardeftab720\ri-720\partightenfactor0

\b \cf2 Interviewee: \cf5 \{convenient_to_use_voice_during_work\}
\b0 \cf0 Yes. It will definitely be more convenient. Actually, when referring to the recipes, I will stop, and the search for the recipe and then I will go back again. Yes, if it is a touch based typing there is a problem. So, while I am cooking if I can ask for a recipe through voice and if I can get it automatically, it would be very convenient. That is my opinion.\cf5 \{/convenient_to_use_voice_during_work\}\cf0 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri-720\partightenfactor0

\b \cf0 Interviewer:   
\b0 Thank you.\

\b Interviewer:  
\b0 I have a couple of more questions. Do you have a laptop, or have you ever had a laptop before?\
\pard\pardeftab720\ri-720\partightenfactor0

\b \cf2 Interviewee: 
\b0 \cf0 Yes, I had a laptop. But now, it is not working. And I don\'92t think a laptop is not much useful to me. I just used my laptop to check my emails. Now, there are smartphones. I use them now to check my email.\
\pard\pardeftab720\ri-720\partightenfactor0

\b \cf0 Interviewer:   
\b0 Ok. When you started using your laptop. Did you experience any difficulties with your laptop? For instance, did you find it hard to login to G-mail and send email?\
\pard\pardeftab720\ri-720\partightenfactor0

\b \cf2 Interviewee: \cf13 \{easy_to_use_laptop\}
\b0 \cf0 No, it was very easy\cf13 \{/easy_to_use_laptop\}\cf0 .\
\pard\pardeftab720\ri-720\partightenfactor0

\b \cf0 Interviewer:   
\b0 Siri, is already present in iPad. So, if you interact with Siri on a daily basis, what would you use it for. You currently use an IPad for listening to music and asking recipes. Do you see any other use for Siri apart from that?\
\pard\pardeftab720\ri-720\partightenfactor0

\b \cf2 Interviewee: \cf9 \{not_that_familiar_with_siri\}
\b0 \cf0 I have not used Siri that much. So, I am not sure, in what way I can use it. \cf9 \{/not_that_familiar_with_siri\}\cf0 \
I am interested in knowing the daily news, Will Siri be able to do it? I feel I might be able to give a concrete reply once I use it.\
\pard\pardeftab720\ri-720\partightenfactor0

\b \cf0 Interviewer:   
\b0 Ok. I understand.\

\b Interviewer:   
\b0 My current question is a follow up to your previous question. Imagine that there is a computer that can talk to you, also, you can talk to the computer to make it to certain tasks, would you like it to use for any other purpose? e.g. people ask Siri about weather. Do you see any such uses?\
\pard\pardeftab720\ri-720\partightenfactor0

\b \cf2 Interviewee: 
\b0 \cf0 Can you please repeat the question?\
\pard\pardeftab720\ri-720\partightenfactor0

\b \cf0 Interviewer:  
\b0 Would you use Siri for anything else apart from news and YouTube. e.g. health related or medicine related?\
\pard\pardeftab720\ri-720\partightenfactor0

\b \cf2 Interviewee: \cf0 \{some_knowledge_about_siri\}\{asking_siri_about_medicine\}
\b0 \cf0 I am not sure. Can we ask Siri such questions, like which medicines can we take?\cf0 \{/asking_siri_about_medicine\}\{/some_knowledge_about_siri\}\cf0 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri-720\partightenfactor0

\b \cf0 Interviewer:   
\b0 Yes. Yes. Something like that. Would you want to do that?\
\pard\pardeftab720\ri-720\partightenfactor0

\b \cf2 Interviewee: 
\b0 \cf0 Yes. I can do that for small illnesses.\
\pard\pardeftab720\ri-720\partightenfactor0

\b \cf0 Interviewer:   
\b0 So, then, considering that Siri is a computer program, would you trust Siri to take decisions for you? For example, you are sick with some symptoms. You want to tell Siri your symptoms and get the diagnosis for the disease. Would you trust Siri for that?\
\pard\pardeftab720\ri-720\partightenfactor0

\b \cf2 Interviewee:\cf14 \{not_completely_trusting_siri\}\cf2  
\b0 \cf0 I will not trust Siri fully. I will just ask Siri for information. I would definitely consult a doctor after that\cf14 \{/not_completely_trusting_siri\}\cf0 .\
\pard\pardeftab720\ri-720\partightenfactor0

\b \cf0 Interviewer:  
\b0 Ok. Thank you for taking this interview with me and thank you for your responses. It was nice chatting with you to get to know your perspective on technology and how you would use it in your daily life. Thank you so much. Enjoy the rest of your day\
